            His first appearance was in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo
            Entertainment System as a boisterous monkey who had one main goal: to become a 
            video game hero just like his friend, Donkey Kong. 
            He accompanies Donkey Kong throughout Donkey Kong Island to battle King K. Rool and return their banana hoard.
            He became the main character in the sequel Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong 
            Quest, teaming up with his inseparable friend Dixie Kong, who both set to rescue 
            Donkey Kong from Kaptain K. Rool.[11] He later appeared in Donkey Kong Land,
            issued a challenge by Cranky Kong that he and Donkey Kong could not retrieve the 
            banana hoard on an 8-bit system.
            The third and final title in the Donkey Kong Country series is titled Donkey Kong
            Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, which stars Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong who 
            must find Diddy and Donkey Kong after they had disappeared, all the while battling a 
            cyborg called KAOS. A follow-up was released in September 1996 for the Game 
            Boy called Donkey Kong Land 2, featuring roughly the same plot as Donkey Kong Country 2.

            Diddy also makes an appearance in 1997's Donkey Kong Land III, but his only
            appearance is on the Extra Life Balloons. He is also a part of the storyline that appears in the manual. 
            He stars in the spin-off racing game Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64, which 
            only features the eponymous character Diddy Kong as a returning character. It 
            introduces Banjo and Conker the Squirrel, who went on to star in Banjo-Kazooie and 
            Conker's Bad Fur Day, respectively. His title was a success, becoming the fastest-
            selling video game in US history at the time.  In 2007, a remake of Diddy Kong Racing was released for the Nintendo DS.
            He later appeared as a playable character in Donkey Kong 64,
            a 3D sequel to the Donkey Kong Country titles,
            where he, Donkey Kong, and others go through DK Island to defeat King K. Rool yet again.
            He has a prominent role in DK King of Swing as well as its sequel,
            DK Jungle Climber.>
            2003 marked the release of the first post-Rare Donkey Kong game that features characters presented in Donkey Kong Country.
            Namco's Donkey Konga is a GameCube music title that was packaged with a DK Bongo controller.
            The controller is used to keep the rhythm with the beats of covers to famous songs (as well as Nintendo video game music).
            It was followed by two sequels, Donkey Konga 2 and Donkey Konga 3, 
            the latter which was only released in Japan.
