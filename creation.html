    Creation of Diddy Kong

    <p>
    During the development of Donkey Kong Country,
    Rare initially conceptualized Diddy as a modernized iteration of Donkey Kong Jr.,
    portrayed as Donkey Kong's offspring.
    However, Nintendo expressed dissatisfaction with the drastic alterations Rare made to Donkey Kong Jr.'s character.
    In response, Nintendo gave Rare an ultimatum: 
    either revise the design to closely resemble the original Donkey Kong Jr. 
    or create an entirely new character. Opting for the latter, Rare decided to rename the character,
    feeling that their creation was a perfect fit for the updated Donkey Kong universe.
    The name chosen was 'Diddy,' inspired by the British English slang term 'diddy,' 
    which in certain regions of the UK refers to something small.
