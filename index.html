                        Diddy Kong (Japanese: ディディーコング, Hepburn: Didī Kongu) is a fictional character who appears in games belonging to the Donkey Kong and Mario video game franchises,
                        debuting in the 1994 Donkey Kong series game Donkey Kong Country.
                        Rare designer Kevin Bayliss commented Diddy Kong was "penciled in" as a spider monkey,
                        although he is not specifically referenced as belonging to a particular species.
                        He lives with Donkey Kong on Donkey Kong Island in the Kongo Jungle,
                        and is identified by his red hat with the Nintendo logo,
                        and his red shirt with stars.
                        Diddy Kong is Donkey Kong's sidekick and best friend.
                        Rare first referred to Diddy as DK's nephew in September 1999 on their website.
                        This was followed in November 1999 where the manual for Donkey Kong 64 called him "Donkey's little nephew wannabe".
                        The official cast for the game in 2002 listed him as "DK's nephew" as well.
                        He was originally created by Donkey Kong Country developer Rare as an updated version of Donkey Kong Jr.,
                        but he was renamed,
                        due to Nintendo's response.
                        In the second game,
                        Dixie Kong was introduced and they were described as "inseparable friends", 
                        with Cranky referring to Dixie as "that girlfriend of his".
