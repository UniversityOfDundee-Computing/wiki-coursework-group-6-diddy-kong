leading to him getting his own spin-off title called Diddy Kong Racing.
He has been featured as a plush toy.

Kotaku editor Mike Fahey described him as the "Scrappy Doo" 
of the Donkey Kong series.
Ars Technica editor Ben Kuchera criticized the removal of Diddy 
and Donkey Kong in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!,
commenting that the new characters made the game less appealing.
GameDaily listed DK and Diddy as collectively one of the best gaming duos.

GameSpy editor Phil Theobald jokingly bemoaned the lack 
of a mini-game in Donkey Konga that allows players to smack Diddy
 Kong, criticizing Rare's designs, which he calls horrible.
UGO.com listed Diddy Kong on their list of 
"The Cutest Video Game Characters" stating that Diddy has 
Donkey Kong as a role model.

Samuel James Riley of GamesRadar listed Diddy Kong along 
with Donkey Kong as the best video game duos, 
and further stated that while they may not be the most 
talkative of double acts, these plucky primates do share 
something of an interesting relationship.Nick Gillett
of The Guardian and David Lozada of GameRevolution both 
described Diddy Kong as one of the best video game sidekicks.

Jeremy Parish of Polygon ranked 73 fighters from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate "from garbage to glorious",
listing Diddy as 47th, stating that "Diddy Kong is really just the poor man's Donkey Kong Jr.
Sadly, Junior himself is said to have died in the Great Ape War, 
which means we're stuck with this second banana.
But we don't have to like it".
</p>
<p>
Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek ranked Diddy Kong as 24th of Super Smash Bros.
Ultimate characters, and said that "Diddy had peanut pistols and a jetpack,
coming off as a primitive James Bond with the tactical height of Oddjob.
Which is pretty cool".
